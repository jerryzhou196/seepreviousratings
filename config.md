**If you are here to remove the "Card Rating History" label, change <i> Show Label </i> to "false"** 

**If you are here to hide the learning stage reviews ([Sowa0](https://github.com/jerryzhou196/seepreviousratings/issues/10) and and [u/boworyx's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ouxzqi/new_addon_see_a_cards_previous_ratings_in_reviewer/h8n127k/?context=3) idea) when the card is in a review stage, change <i> "only-show-learning-reviews-in-learning-stage"
 </i> to "true!"** 

To change the postion to the top of the card reviewers, change to "top" instead of "bottom". 

Horizontal adjustment is still a work in progress as it's super buggy.
